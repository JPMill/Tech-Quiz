# Tech Quiz

## Overview
Tech Quiz is a web-based application designed to test users' knowledge of technology-related topics through a randomized quiz. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), it provides an interactive and engaging experience for users looking to assess and improve their skills.

## Features
- **Dynamic Quiz Generation**: Each session presents users with a unique set of ten randomly selected questions.
- **Score Tracking**: Users receive a final score at the end of the quiz.
- **Seamless Navigation**: Users can progress through the quiz smoothly with immediate feedback.
- **Replay Option**: After completing the quiz, users can restart and attempt another quiz session.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (UI rendering and state management)
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js (API and business logic)
- **Database**: MongoDB (storing quiz data and user scores)
- **Testing**: Cypress (component and end-to-end testing)

## Purpose
Tech Quiz is designed for aspiring developers and tech enthusiasts to challenge their knowledge and identify areas for improvement. The project emphasizes the importance of testing in software development by incorporating Cypress for automated testing.

## Future Enhancements
- User authentication for personalized quiz history tracking.
- A broader question bank with categorized topics.
- Timed quizzes for an added challenge.
